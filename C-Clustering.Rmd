# Q1. Initial data analysis tasks.

```{r 1.init}
```

## (i) Summarise the data in the Characteristics.csv dataset, and plot the distributions for the percentage of industrial and commercial customers, transformer ratings and pole or ground monitored substations.

## (ii) Using this and other analyses you think appropriate, describe the relationships between the different substation characteristics (transformer type, number of customers, rating, percentage of I&C customers and number of feeders).

# Q2. Initial clustering tasks
## Using the scaled daily measurements from the January_2013 dataset perform hierarchical clustering for the daily average demand (that is each 10 minute period for the given substation should be averaged over all days where measurement is available):

```{r 2.init}
```

## (i) Using your preferred choice of a dissimilarity function, create a distance matrix for these data and produce a dendrogram.


## (ii) Choose an appropriate number of clusters and label each substation according to its cluster membership.


## (iii) For each of your clusters, plot the daily average demand for 1) All days, 2) Weekdays, 3) Saturdays and 4) Sundays.


## (iv) Produce summaries of the variables in Characteristics.csv for each of your clusters.



## (v) Desribe your clusters based on the information in Characteristics.csv and choose names for them. Describe the patterns of their power demands for each cluster.

# Q3. Allocating new substations
## The Dataset NewSubstations.csv contains information for five new substations.

```{r 3.init}
```
## (i) For each substation, on the same plot, plot the daily average demand for 1) All days, 2) Weekdays, 3) Saturdays and 4) Sundays (one plot per new substation).


## (ii) Using k-means (or other version, i.e. based on medians), allocate these new substations to one of your clusters


## (iii) Based on your summaries and plots, is the cluster allocation as you expected?

# Q4. Exploring differences between years
